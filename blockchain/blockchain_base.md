# Blockchain basics
## Candidates
* platform
  * Hyperledger
  * Ethereum
  * NEO
* Applications
  * https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/cryptotulips
  * CryptoTulips are like digital collectables, they are one-of-a kind digital art pieces 100% owned by you, cannot be forged, or taken away. CryptoTulips are unique pieces of digital art on the Ethereum blockchain. They can be kept in any Ethereum wallet (we suggest MetaMask). You can trade them on our marketplace and gift to loved ones. Defined by the Ethereum contract, there will be a limited number of tulips and no farming or growing of new tulips.

### popular systems
* *BigChainDB*: an *open source* system that “starts with a big data distributed database and then adds blockchain characteristics — decentralized control, immutability and the transfer of *digital assets*”.
* *Chain Core*, a blockchain platform for issuing and transferring financial assets on a *permissioned blockchain infrastructure*.
* *Corda*, a distributed ledger platform with pluggable consensus.
* *Credits*, a development framework for building permissioned distributed ledgers.
* *Domus Tower Blockchain*: designed for regulated environments, benchmarked at ingesting over 1 million transactions per second.
* *Elements Blockchain Platform*, an open source, protocol-level technology for extending the functionality of Bitcoin.
* **Eris:db**, an *open source*, protocol-level technology for extending the functionality of Bitcoin.
* *Ethereum*, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built blockchain.
* *HydraChain*, an Ethereum extension for creating Permissioned Distributed Ledgers for private and consortium chains.
* *Hyperledger Fabric*, which supports the use of one or more networks, each managing different Assets, Agreements and Transactions between different sets of Member nodes.
* *Hyperledger Iroha*, a “simple and modularized” distributed ledger system with emphasis on mobile application development.
* *Hyperledger Sawtooth Lake*, a modular blockchain suite in which transaction business logic is decoupled from the consensus layer.
* *Multichain*, an open-source **blockchain platform**, based on bitcoin’s blockchain, for multi-asset financial transactions.
* *Openchain*, an open source distributed ledger system for issuing and managing digital assets.
* *Quorum*, an *open source* distributed ledger and smart contract *platform* based on Ethereum.
* *Stellar*, an *open-source*, distributed payments infrastructure that provides RESTful HTTP API servers which connect to Stellar Core, the backbone of the Stellar network.
* *Symbiont Assembly*, a distributed ledger inspired by Apache Kafka.
* **Gospel** : `https://gospel.tech/`, Trusted enterprise data,
  * enterprise grade security platform, underpinned by blockchain, that enables data to be accessed and tracked with absolute trust and security
  * At the heart of Gospel is a `private`, permissioned distributed ledger, containing not only the key data that forms the value of your business (i.e intellectual property / personal data / sensitive content / healthcare records etc.) but also an absolute record of all trusted transactions taken upon it that are unlocked by Gospel’s Distributed Data Logic.
  * Gospel *LedgerBridge* is the technology that allows data to be translated and copied onto the Gospel Cloud and underlying Blockchain.
    * ensuring that data copied from centralised systems is absolutely secured as it is translated to transactions on ledger.
  * Gospel LedgerNode(s)
  * Gospel TrustLink
## Terms
* DLT:  Distributed Ledger Technology
  * an append-only database technology in which every new block of information is encrypted with a part of the previous one
  * This builds up into a chain, where if it were even possible to remove a link – this would be identified immediately
