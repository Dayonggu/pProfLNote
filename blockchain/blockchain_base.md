### popular systems
* *BigChainDB*: an *open source* system that “starts with a big data distributed database and then adds blockchain characteristics — decentralized control, immutability and the transfer of *digital assets*”.
* *Chain Core*, a blockchain platform for issuing and transferring financial assets on a *permissioned blockchain infrastructure*.
* *Corda*, a distributed ledger platform with pluggable consensus.
* *Credits*, a development framework for building permissioned distributed ledgers.
* *Domus Tower Blockchain*: designed for regulated environments, benchmarked at ingesting over 1 million transactions per second.
* *Elements Blockchain Platform*, an open source, protocol-level technology for extending the functionality of Bitcoin.
* **Eris:db**, an *open source*, protocol-level technology for extending the functionality of Bitcoin.
* *Ethereum*, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built blockchain.
* *HydraChain*, an Ethereum extension for creating Permissioned Distributed Ledgers for private and consortium chains.
* *Hyperledger Fabric*, which supports the use of one or more networks, each managing different Assets, Agreements and Transactions between different sets of Member nodes.
* *Hyperledger Iroha*, a “simple and modularized” distributed ledger system with emphasis on mobile application development.
* *Hyperledger Sawtooth Lake*, a modular blockchain suite in which transaction business logic is decoupled from the consensus layer.
* *Multichain*, an open-source **blockchain platform**, based on bitcoin’s blockchain, for multi-asset financial transactions.
* *Openchain*, an open source distributed ledger system for issuing and managing digital assets.
* *Quorum*, an *open source* distributed ledger and smart contract *platform* based on Ethereum.
* *Stellar*, an *open-source*, distributed payments infrastructure that provides RESTful HTTP API servers which connect to Stellar Core, the backbone of the Stellar network.
* *Symbiont Assembly*, a distributed ledger inspired by Apache Kafka.
* **Gospel** : `https://gospel.tech/`, Trusted enterprise data,
  * enterprise grade security platform, underpinned by blockchain, that enables data to be accessed and tracked with absolute trust and security
  * At the heart of Gospel is a `private`, permissioned distributed ledger, containing not only the key data that forms the value of your business (i.e intellectual property / personal data / sensitive content / healthcare records etc.) but also an absolute record of all trusted transactions taken upon it that are unlocked by Gospel’s Distributed Data Logic.
  * Gospel *LedgerBridge* is the technology that allows data to be translated and copied onto the Gospel Cloud and underlying Blockchain.
    * ensuring that data copied from centralised systems is absolutely secured as it is translated to transactions on ledger.
  * Gospel LedgerNode(s)
  * Gospel TrustLink
## Terms
* DLT:  Distributed Ledger Technology
  * an append-only database technology in which every new block of information is encrypted with a part of the previous one
  * This builds up into a chain, where if it were even possible to remove a link – this would be identified immediately
